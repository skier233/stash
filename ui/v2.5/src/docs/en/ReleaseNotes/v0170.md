After migrating, please run a scan on your entire library to populate missing data, and to ingest identical files which were previously ignored.

### Other changes:
* Import/export schema has changed and is incompatible with the previous version.
* Changelog has been moved from the stats page to a section in the Settings page.
* Object titles are now displayed as the file basename if the title is not explicitly set. The `Don't include file extension as part of the title` scan flag is no longer supported.
* `Set name, date, details from embedded file metadata` scan flag is no longer supported. This functionality may be implemented as a built-in scraper in the future.
